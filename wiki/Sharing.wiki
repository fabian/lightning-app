= Introduction =

A list always has one owner. The list can be shared with other users which can edit the items in the list, but not the list name or it's sharing settings. The owner of a list has control who has access to the list.


= Steps =

== Inviting ==

  * User creates a new LIST and is therefor the owner of the LIST.
  * Owner picks in the sharing settings a new person he'd like to share the list with (via ABAddressBook).
  * A new INVITATION row is created on the server with the persons name and email address.
  * iPhone sends a mail with a token for the invitation (say lightning:invitation?ABC123) to the person.
  * Invitee opens link in mail on the iPhone.
  * A new SHAREDLIST is created on the server to associate the DEVICE with the INVITATION and finally the LIST.

== Suspending ==

  * Owner removes a person from the sharing settings of a LIST.
  * The INVITATION gets marked as deleted on the server.
  * Next time the invitee tries to view/update the LIST it gets removed from his lists.
